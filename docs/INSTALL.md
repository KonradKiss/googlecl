# DEPENDENCIES

GoogleCL requires Python 2.7 and the gdata python client library.
You can get the library from the project homepage:
```bash
    http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/
```
The installation directions for the client library should also contain
directions on installing Python, if you don't have it already.

## INSTALLING GOOGLECL
Short instructions:
From the command line, in the directory as this file, run
```bash
    $ sudo python setup.py install

or

    $ python setup.py install --home=~
```
(remember to set your PYTHONPATH to include your home directory if you
do it this way)

For more detailed instructions, I recommend looking at the gdata-python-client
INSTALL.txt file. It also has instructions on modifying PYTHONPATH.
